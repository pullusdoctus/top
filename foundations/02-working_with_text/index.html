  <h1>HTML Elements: Basic Text</h1>
  <p>This little document aims to show the most basic HTML elements in action. These elements will let you create a
    basic document quickly, so understanding their use is the first step in any web developer's journey!.</p>

  <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
  <p>Paragraphs are the basic way to output text on the browser. I'd even say they're the standard way to do this.
    Chances are, any text you've ever seen on a webpage is a paragraph!</p>
  <p>The way to create a paragraph is by using the `&lt;p&gt;` tag around whatever text you want as the paragraph.</p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>If you want to create sections within your document, use headings! The slightly bigger text that you see on this
    document is all headings.</p>
  <p>Headings help create visual headers, which is useful for human readers, but it also creates sections that can be
    detected by software, which makes it useful for formatting and parsing.</p>
  <p>The way to create a heading is by using the `&lt;hn&gt;` tag around whatever text you want as the heading. Do note
    that HTML has six levels of headings, so you must specify the heading level with a number instead of `n` (&lt;h1&gt;
    creates a Header 1).</p>

  <h2>Emphasis</h2>
  <p>If you want to <strong>emphasize</strong> a <em>certain</em> phrase, you can make the text <strong>bold</strong> or
    <em>italic</em>! This emphasis, much like headings, is not just visual, but it also adds semantic emphasis to the
    text, which can be detected by certain software tools.
  </p>
  <p>The way to create bold text is by wrapping the text in a `&lt;strong&gt;` tag. For italic text, you use
    `&lt;em&gt;` instead.</p>
